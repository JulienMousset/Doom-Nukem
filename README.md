Game: pasosa-s, jmousset

Editor: neil

### Compile & run

This program can run on Linux only. Compatibility with Mac OS has been abandoned, it might work or might not.

You will need the following packages:
- libsdl2-dev
- libsdl2-image-dev
- libsdl2-mixer-dev
- libsdl2-ttf-dev

Then run make. It will compile our libft, then the program itself.

You can run it with `./doom-nukem`.

If you want to edit a specific map, you can use the `--editor` command: `./doom-nukem --editor maps/level_3`.

Enjoy.
